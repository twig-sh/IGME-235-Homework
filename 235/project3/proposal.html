    <p>Platformer, Arcade</p>

    <h2>III. Platform</h2>
    <p>Desktop only</p>

    <h2>IV. Story</h2>
    <p>This game is a coin collection game that pushes the player to reach for the highest score possible. The player is acting under constant time pressure to clear the screen and increase the timer so they can get a higher score. This should add a feeling of pressure as the player is trying to beat the clock.</p>

    <p>Sound - 8-bit</p>
    <p>Sounds - Coin collected, jump</p>

    <h3>Onboarding</h3>
    <p>There will be a seperate controls screen on the main menu</p>

    <h3>Player learning</h3>
    <p>The player will need to keep collecting coins to gain score and add to the timer, once the timer runs out the game is over and score is totaled.</p>
